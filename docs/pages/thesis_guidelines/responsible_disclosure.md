# Responsible disclosure

A discovered vulnerability should first be reported to the vendor. The vendor should then be given the opportunity to develop a patch. After the patch has been published, or in the case of an unresponsive vendor, after a certain timeframe passes, the finding should be reported to the National Vulnerability Database and made public. The Dutch National Cybersecurity Center US CERT offers a good [Guide to
Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure](https://english.ncsc.nl/binaries/ncsc-en/documents/publications/2019/juni/01/coordinated-vulnerability-disclosure-the-guideline/WEB_Brochure-NCSC_EN.pdf) which we recommend that you follow, setting the default disclosure timeframe to 90 days. Your supervisor can assist you in the reporting process. 

If the disclosure process takes longer time than your thesis project, you can still present your thesis, complete the course and receive your credits. KTH will, however, not publish the report until the disclosure process has completed.
