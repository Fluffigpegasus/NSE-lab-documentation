# Synchronous tutoring meetings

During fall of 2020, Pontus Johnson offers videoconferencing tutoring meetings over Zoom every Friday at 09:00-10:00 for those who would like to meet synchronously. Some sessions may be cancelled or rescheduled. If so, that is communicated via ssas-students.slack.com. 

# Asynchronous tutoring

Beyond the weekly meeting, you may receive assistance from your supervisor over Slack (ssas-students.slack.com - ask your supervisor to register you if you are not already) or email. 

# Weekly update

Please to submit a weekly update to your tutor (over ssas-students.slack.com or per e-mail), responding to these questions:
- What has happened since last update?
- What are your plans for the coming work?
- Do you need assistance?
