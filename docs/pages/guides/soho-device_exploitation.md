# SOHO Device Exploitation
Among the very many to be found on the Internet, [here](https://blog.grimm-co.com/2020/06/soho-device-exploitation.html) is one interesting write-up of the discovery and exploitation process of a SOHO device (a Netgear router). 
[Another interesting study on router security](https://www.fkie.fraunhofer.de/content/dam/fkie/de/documents/HomeRouter/HomeRouterSecurity_2020_Bericht.pdf) was performed by the Fraunhofer Institute in 2020, finding a surprising number of vulnerabilities.
